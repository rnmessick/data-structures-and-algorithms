# Stacks and Queues

Implement a Stack and a Queue Data Structure

## Challenge

Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next node.

Create a Stack class that has a top property. It creates an empty Stack when instantiated.
This object should be aware of a default empty value assigned to top when the stack is created.

- Define a method called **push** which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the top of the stack with an O(1) Time performance.
- Define a method called **pop** that does not take any argument, removes the node from the top of the stack, and returns the node’s value.
- Define a method called **peek** that does not take an argument and returns the value of the node located on top of the stack, without removing it from the stack.

Create a Queue class that has a front property. It creates an empty Queue when instantiated.
This object should be aware of a default empty value assigned to front when the queue is created.

- Define a method called **enqueue** which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the back of the queue with an O(1) Time performance.
- Define a method called **dequeue** that does not take any argument, removes the node from the front of the queue, and returns the node’s value.
- Define a method called **peek** that does not take an argument and returns the value of the node located in the front of the queue, without removing it from the queue.
