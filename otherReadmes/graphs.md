## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available in your Graph -->
- AddNode()
Adds a new node to the graph
Takes in the value of that node
Returns the added node

- AddEdge()
Adds a new edge between two nodes in the graph
Include the ability to have a “weight”
Takes in the two nodes to be connected by the edge
Both nodes should already be in the Graph

- GetNodes()
Returns all of the nodes in the graph as a collection (set, list, or similar)

- GetNeighbors()
Returns a collection of nodes connected to the given node
Takes in a given node
Include the weight of the connection in the returned collection

- Size()
Returns the total number of nodes in the graph
