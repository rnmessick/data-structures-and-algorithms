# Get Edge Graph

Given a business trip itinerary, and an Alaska Airlines route map, is the trip possible with direct flights? If so, how much will the total trip cost be?

## Challenge
Write a function based on the specifications above, which takes in a graph, and an array of city names. 

Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return whether the full trip is possible with direct flights, and how much it would cost.
