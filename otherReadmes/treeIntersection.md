# Tree Intersection

Find common values in 2 binary trees.

## Challenge

Write a function called tree_intersection that takes two binary tree parameters.

Without utilizing any of the built-in library methods available to your language, return a set of values found in both trees.

## Approach & Efficiency

## Algorithm

1. Define a string
2. convert string to lowercase? 
3. split the string into words
4. nested loop to find the repeated word(s)
5. if match exists and we want to count the occurrences, increment int count by 1 and set the duplicates of word to "0" to avoid counting it again.
6. if count is greater than 1, we have duplicates of the word
