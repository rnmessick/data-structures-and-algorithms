# Hashtables


## Challenge

Implementation: Hash Tables

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

## API
**.add**: takes in both the key and value. This method should hash the key, and add the key and value pair to the table, handling collisions as needed.

**.get**: takes in the key and returns the value from the table.

**.contains** : takes in the key and returns a boolean, indicating if the key exists in the table already.

**.hash**: takes in an arbitrary key and returns an index in the collection.
