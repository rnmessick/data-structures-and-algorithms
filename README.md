# Reverse an Array

Reverse array "in place" without using any library shortcuts.

## Challenge
Take in an array and reverse the elements of the array returning a changed array.

## Approach & Efficiency
At first I tried to itterate over the entire array's length. This did not give the results I'd hoped for. I researched a bit until I found a blog that seemed to fit my needs and the parameters of the assignment. See resources.
