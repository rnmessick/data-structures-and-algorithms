# Binary Tree

## Challenge

Implement a Tree

## Approach & Efficiency

## Feature Tasks

1A. Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the node, the left child node, and the right child node.

1B. Create a BinaryTree class

1C. Define a method for each of the depth first traversals called preOrder, inOrder, and postOrder which returns an array of the values, ordered appropriately.

2A. Create a BinarySearchTree class

2B. Define a method named add that accepts a value, and adds a new node with that value in the correct location in the binary search tree.

2C. Define a method named contains that accepts a value, and returns a boolean indicating whether or not the value is in the tree at least once.

**Write a breadth first traversal method which takes a Binary Tree as its unique input.**

Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, traverse the input tree using a Breadth-first approach; print every visited nodeâ€™s value.
