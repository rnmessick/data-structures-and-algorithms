## API

<!-- Description of each method publicly available to your Linked List -->

**Insert** which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.

**Includes** which takes any value as an argument and returns a boolean result depending on whether that value exists as a Nodeâ€™s value somewhere within the list.

**toString** which takes in no arguments and returns a string representing all the values in the Linked List.
