# Find a Repeated Word

Find the first repeated word in a book.

## Challenge

Write a function that accepts a lengthy string parameter.

Without utilizing any of the built-in library methods available to your language, return the first word to occur more than once in that provided string.

## Approach & Efficiency

## Algorithm

1. Define a string
2. convert string to lowercase? 
3. split the string into words
4. nested loop to find the repeated word(s)
5. if match exists and we want to count the occurrences, increment int count by 1 and set the duplicates of word to "0" to avoid counting it again.
6. if count is greater than 1, we have duplicates of the word
