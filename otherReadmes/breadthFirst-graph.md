# Breadth-First Traversal of a Graph

Implement a breadth-first traversal on a graph.

## Challenge
Extend your graph object with a breadth-first traversal method that accepts a starting node. 

Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return a collection of nodes in the order they were visited. Display the collection.

## Approach & Efficiency

## Algorithm
From Codefellows:

Here is what the algorithm breadth first traversal looks like:

1. Enqueue the declared start node into the Queue.
2. Create a loop that will run while the node still has nodes present.
3. Dequeue the first node from the queue
4. if the Dequeueâ€˜d node has unvisited child nodes, mark the unvisited children as visited and re-insert them back into the queue.
